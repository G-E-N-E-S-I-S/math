# Math
This project is the product of me fucking around in math class when i don't have anything to do.
All of this was overcomplicated on purpose. :-)

# Features
+ GUI that draws polygon and displays various data such as side length and angles
+ Variadic vector that allows operating with varying-dimension math (2d vector + 4d vector for example) 
+ Polygon math (Midpoints, sides, angles, area, circumference, triangle medians)
+ Statistical analysis (Max, min, average, variance)
