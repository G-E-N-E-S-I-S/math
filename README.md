# Math
This project is just me fucking around in math lectures when i don't have anything anything to do, all of this is overcomplicated on purpose.

# Features
+ GUI that draws polygon and displays various data such as side length and angles
+ Variadic vector that allows operating with varying-dimension math (2d vector + 4d vector for example) 
+ Polygon math (Midpoints, sides, angles, area, circumference, triangle medians)
+ Statistical analysis (Max, min, average, variance)
